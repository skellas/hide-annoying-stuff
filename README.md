# Chromium Extension - Hide Annoying Website Features
This extension allow me to hide the parts of websites that I don't like, mainly... things like : 
 * Facebook's right side bar
 * Twitter's entire right side bar

As I come across more sites where I can improve my quality of life, I'll add more to this extension.
