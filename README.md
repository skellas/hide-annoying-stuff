# Chromium Extension - Hide Annoying Website Features
This extension allow me to hide the parts of websites that I don't like, mainly... things like : 
 * Facebook's right side bar
 * Twitter's entire right side bar

As I come across more sites where I can improve my quality of life, I'll add more to this extension. 

## Install Extension from Local Code Repo
 1. Open Manage Extensions
 2. Enable Dev Mode
 3. Click 'Load Unpacked'
 4. Select the folder containing the top level manifest
